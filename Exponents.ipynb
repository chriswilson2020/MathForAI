    "An exponent referes to how many times a number is multiplied by itself for example 2 to the third or two cubed is written as $2^3$: $$2 \\times 2 \\times 2 = 8$$\n",

    "1. A number raised to the power of 1 is always itself: $$a^1 = a$$ $$ 5^1 = 5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the exponent is zero the expression is always equal to 1:<br><br>\n",
    "$$ a^0 = 1$$ $$ 6^0 = 1$$ $$14,356^0 = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When the exponent is a negative number, the result is always a fraction.  The numerator is always 1 and the denominator is the result of the positive exponent:<br><br>\n",

    "You can also have a variable to a given power such as $a^3$ which means $a \\times a \\times a$ you can also have a number to a variable power for example $2^m$ which would mean $ 2 \\times 2 \\; m$ times"
